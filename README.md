## Future Adaptations

Currently the upvote feature is only a visual feature. I would like to implement including a backend and being able to actually save the data. I will likely do this using MongoDB as hosting this information wouldn't be difficult, especially if I'm using Mongoose as schema validation. For the incomplexity of the data, using a noSQL database would be sufficient here. Also, hosting with MongoDB is cheaper that using a SQL database and hosting through something like Heroku.

## Accreditations
